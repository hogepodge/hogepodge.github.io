              research projects.</a> Taught courses in cloud computing and delivered several talks on using OpenStack
              for scientific computing at conferences, including OSCON. Expertise in OpenStack, scientific cloud
              computing, research workflows, and data warehousing. Activities also included supporting research in
              brain imaging for diagnosis and treatment of traumatic brain injury. Worked in C++, Java, Python, and
              Clojure.

              Developed high-performance signal process algorithms for analyzing dense-array EEG data in C++ with MPI
              and OpenMP. Created a template-based MPI data library to serialize objects automatically and optimally.

              guarantee that automated instrumentation libraries did not lose or corrupt data.
