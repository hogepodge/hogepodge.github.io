                Improving the first-run experience for users by building Python

              (PTL) for the puppet-openstack modules. Was responsible for testing,
              release management, and project guidance, including developing shared
              tools and libraries to reduce code duplication in the
              puppet-openstack modules. Advocated for creating a new track at the
              OpenStack summits to give open source projects adjacent to the
              OpenStack community collaboration and development space. Supported
              the marketing team in promoting Puppet at industry events.
